# The Dungeons of Zrevius 
A small project I've been working on for a while now. A randomly generated dungeon crawling text game, filled with loot, monsters, traps, interesting characters and quests!

(As an aside, its still early in development so most of those things aren't there yet, and if they are, it isnt very polished!)

##### A Screensho- uhh.... Textshot?
```
>>> Look

You look at the Room
You open the door to confront a room of odd pillars. Water rushes down from several holes in the ceiling and falls through similar holes in the floor, flowing down to some unknown depth.

You look through the Room and see...

1 ) Hole in the wall
2 ) Broken Door
3 ) Broken Crate
4 ) Rations
5 ) Back

>>>  1

You look at the Hole in the wall
A rather large hole in the wall, beyond, all you see is darkness that seems to go on forever.
Go through the Hole in the wall?

1 ) Go through
2 ) Back

>>> 1

You head through the Hole in the wall and into a room.

>>> look

```

#### You can use the dungeon generator in your game.

While an actual game is still missing, the foundation of the Dungeon Generator is working! Checkout the wiki on using it! [Using the Dungeon Generator In Your Game](https://github.com/Firetryer/TextRougelike/wiki/Using-the-Dungeon-Generator-in-your-game.)

 Will update it with more information in the future
