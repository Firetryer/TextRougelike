# The Dungeons of Zrevius 
A small project I've been working on for a while now. A randomly generated dungeon crawling text game, filled with loot, monsters, traps, interesting characters and quests!

(As an aside, its still early in development so most of those things aren't there yet, and if they are, it isnt very polished!)

##### A Screensho- uhh.... Textshot?
```
>>> Look

You look at the Room

You opened the door to confront a room of odd pillars. Water rushes down from several
holes in the ceiling and falls through similar holes in the floor, flowing down to 
some unknown depth.

You look through the Room and see...

1 ) Hole in the wall
2 ) Broken Door
3 ) Broken Crate
4 ) Rations
5 ) Back

>>>  1

You look at the Hole in the wall

A rather large hole in the wall, beyond, all you see is darkness that seems to go on forever.

Go through the Hole in the wall?

1 ) Go through
2 ) Back

>>> 1

You head through the Hole in the wall and into a room.

>>> look

```


#### To Run

You need python 3.6.x

run ```game_functions.py``` 



#### Features Completed
1) Randomly generated dungeon.
2) Semi-randomly generated equipment(Only weapons for now), and various other things you can pick up and equip.
3) Move around the different areas.
4) Semi-Randomly generated monsters with stats. (Can't interact with them for now though)

3) Consumable Use
4) More Item Variety
5) More Monster Variety
