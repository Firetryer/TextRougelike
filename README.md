# TextRougelike
A VERY early WIP text rougelike game. Theres still nothing to see in terms of an actual game, the framework/ backend is still being developed. The name is temporary as well!



## Will feature:


  Random Dungeon Generation      (Maze generation is done, currently working on populating it with monsters / loot)

  Semi-Random Monster Generation (24% Finished)

  Semi-Random Loot ( Still working on it )

  Quests (Havn't Started yet)

  Different Modes (Story, Endless Dungeon, etc..) ( Definitely havn't started on yet.)

  (Will add more features as I start to finish the game more. Practicing not to feature creep :) )
