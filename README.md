# The Dungeons of Zrevius 
A small project I've been working on for a while now. A randomly generated dungeon crawling text game, filled with loot, monsters, traps, interesting characters and quests!

(As an aside, its still early in development so most of those things aren't there yet, and if they are, it isnt very polished!)

#### You can use the dungeon generator in your game.

Checkout the wiki on using it! [Using the Dungeon Generator In Your Game](https://github.com/Firetryer/TextRougelike/wiki/Using-the-Dungeon-Generator-in-your-game.)
 Will update it with more information in the future

#### Will feature:


  Random Dungeon Generation      (Maze generation is done, currently working on populating it with monsters / loot)

  Semi-Random Monster Generation (24% Finished)

  Semi-Random Loot ( Still working on it )

  Quests (Havn't Started yet)

  Different Modes (Story, Endless Dungeon, etc..) ( Definitely havn't started on yet.)

  (Will add more features as I start to finish the game more. Practicing not to feature creep :) )



  All the names(Except a few) are from http://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/

  Thanks for saving me an hour of thinking up of names!
