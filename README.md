# TextRougelike
A VERY early WIP text rougelike game. Theres still nothing to see in terms of an actual game, the framework/ backend is still being developed. The name is temporary as well! 



## Will feature:


  Random Dungeon Generation      (Backend already finished)
  
  Semi-Random Monster Generation (Imagine the same fantasy monsters, but with different attributes, skills each game)
  
  Semi-Random Loot
  
  Quests
  
  (Will add more features as I start to finish the game more. Practicing not to feature creep :) )
